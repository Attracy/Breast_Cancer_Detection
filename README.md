🩺 Breast Cancer Detection (Classification)

This project predicts whether a tumor is Malignant or Benign using machine learning classification on the Breast Cancer dataset.

📌 Objective

To build a classification model that helps in early detection of breast cancer based on medical features.

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

Pandas, NumPy (data preprocessing)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA/visualization)

Scikit-learn (model training & evaluation)
🔍 Workflow

Data loading & cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature scaling / preprocessing

Train-test split

Model training and evaluation

🤖 Models Used

Logistic Regression / other classification models (as implemented in notebook)

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Classification Report

✅ Key Findings

Model effectively classifies tumors into Benign/Malignant

Useful for understanding which features strongly impact cancer detection
